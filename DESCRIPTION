Description: An implementation of sequential tests and online change-point
  detection algorithms. This package supports 
  APIs of nonparametric sequential test and online change-point detection for 
  streams of univariate (sub-)Gaussian, binary, and bounded random variables. 
  This package also provides APIs of general E-value based sequential test and
  E-detectors based change-point detection frameworks for advanced users.
